# UserApplication
Android application featuring user registration and login via SQLite database.
The requirement for developing this application is for the completion of the final Semester 3 of my diploma.
My motivation behind the concept for this app comes from my personal experience working in the racehorse industry.
At the time, I was inspired to develop a project in excel to take away from normal day to day duties. 
The excel project involved recording and storing data on yearling weights coming up to the sales season.
Through storing weekly weights, one could track trends through access to graphs and determine whether there may be 
an underlying cause for sudden weight loss or weight gain, where and when best grass growth occurs and monitor feeding regimes.
I dreamed of developing this into a portable android application. It would be easily acceptable for farm users on the move, and easy
to use for non-tech experts. The ability to store user data, and following this, assign "equine profiles" to where weekly weights 
be inserted and analysed.
